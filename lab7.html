        <p>
            The lion is a wild terrestrial animal called the king of the forest. The lion is a strong animal with a
             strong body, a big head,
             a majestic mane, and two fierce eyes. Lions are predatory animals and eat only after hunting. They have strong
              claws and sharp teeth, which help them hunt their prey and eat the flesh.
